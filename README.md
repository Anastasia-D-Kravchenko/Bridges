# Bridges
 This site will help you get acquainted with bridges and learn what they are in general. You will also have a chance to assemble a bridge yourself in the form of a jigsaw puzzle. Then you can help people get to the other side of the river by placing a bridge for them. I recommend that you take the bridge logic test to get the skill to assess what bridge and in what situation should be put. And then enjoy the aesthetics of the bridges.
